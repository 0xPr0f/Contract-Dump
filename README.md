# Contract Dump

This is a repo for dumping most of my part time smart contract code, they are usually about integrating protocols to do stuffs.

The smart contract here may vary in terms of logic and ideas, feel free to make an issue or pr for any of the code.

These contract are mainly product of testing features and learning.
