# Agreement Token stream

This is a test project that implement a basic token stream from a user to another user and vice versa simultaneously exchanging tokens.

## steps

1). userA request a stream to userB and userB approves the stream of a specific amount of two different or same tokens.
2). userA start the stream and then userA and userB exchange their both token
3). The rest is history

This was made using superfluid new ACL stuffs lol
This is an idea that can be greatly expanded on
